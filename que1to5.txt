 Q1. What are conditional statements? Explain conditional statements with
  syntax and examples.
 ans.  The conditional statements is a programing that can be execute in the different
 block of code. they allow to program to behave accordingly to the code.

 if statement 
 x = 10;
 if(x > 5) {
    console.log(" x is greater than 5")
 };
output: x is greater than 5.

if else statements :
x = 10;
if(x > 5) {
    console.log("x is greater than 5")
} else {
    console.log("x is less than 5")
};
output : x is greater than 5


if else if else statement :
x = 5
if(x > 10){
    console.log("x is greater than 10")
} else if(x == 10) {
    console.log("x is equal to 10")
} else{
    console.log("x is less than 10")
};
output: x is less than 10;

if else nested statement :
x = 5;
y = 5;
if(x >= 4){
    console.log("x is greater than 4")
    if(y == 5){
        console.log(" y is equal to 5")
    }
}else {
    console.log("x is less than 4")
};
output: x is greater than 5 or y is equal to 5.

conditional operator;
> (greater than)
< (less than)
= (equal to)
<= (less than and equal to)
>= (greater than and equal to)
!= (not equal to )
their are conditional opearator to apply in condition how to perform.

 Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops 
 with their syntax and examples.
ans. the loops are the programing, we use that type of code that excute in a block 
of scope till the code finised or in a specific number of time.
syntex of loops,
for loops:
for (intiatial; condition; increment/decrement){
 code to be executed
}  

e.g. for loops
for(i = 0;i < 5; i++){
    console.log(i)
};
output: 0,1,2,3,4

while loops:

i = 0;
while(i < 5){
    console.log(i);
     i++;
}
output: 0,1,2,3,4

do while loop :
i = 0;
do{
console.log(i);
i++;
}while(i < 5);
output: 0,1,2,3,4;

break and continue statement:

for(i = 0;i < 5;i++){
    if(i===3){
        break;// break the loop when is up to 3.
    }
    console.log(i);
};

for(i = 0;i < 5;i++){
    if(i===3){
        continue;// swipe the 3 and then continue,
    }
    console.log(i);
};



 Q4. Generate numbers between any 2 given numbers.
 Ex
 const num1 = 10
 const num2 = 25;
 Output: 11, 12, 13, â€¦., 25
 ans.   
 
gerenrate number between 10 to 25;
using for loop :


 for(num = 11; num < 26; num++){
    console.log(num)
 }


Q5. Use the while loop to print numbers from 1 to 25 in ascending and descending order.
 ans.
  Using while loop to print numbers 
  from 1 to 25 in ascending and descending order.

i = 1;
  while(i <= 25){
    console.log(i);
    i++;
  }
  
  i = 25;
  while(i >= 1){
    console.log(i);
   i--;
  }
